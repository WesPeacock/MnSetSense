# Attach Sense numbers to Main References

### Introduction

This repo contains scripts to convert a FLEx project that has subentries that have the sense of a entry as the component, rather than the main entry of that component.

It finds the subentries that contain a certain tag in the entry residue field. The tag contains a specified SFM with a sensenumber. It  changes the component reference from a entry reference to refer to the corresponding sense.

### An Example

Let's consider an English complex form "molehunt", a search for an employee spying for a competitor. It has two components "mole" and "hunt." The word "mole" has two senses, the first is an underground insectivore, the second a spy in the organisation. 
A simple SFM file for the Piglatin to English versions of the entries might look like the example below. It is simple in that other homographs of "mole" and senses of "hunt" are ignored.:

````SFM
\lx olemay
\hm 1
\et Germanic: mol
\sn 1
\ps n
\ge mole
\de small insectivore that lives underground
\sn 2
\ps n
\ge mole
\de an employee who spies for a competitor
\us jargon, espionage

\lx olehuntmay
\mn olemay 2
\mn unthay
\ps n
\ge molehunt
\de an investigation attempting to identify agents who have infiltrated an organisation
\us jargon, espionage

\lx unthay
\ps v
\ge hunt
\de to find or search for an animal in the wild with the intention of killing the animal
````
This file would be processed to set up the multiple \mn entries in "molehunt." 

The 2nd \mn entry will be processed by the *mn2xref.pl* script to be a lf / lv pair where the lf marker will contain the sense # if any and the order of the main reference.

The first main reference is set up move the sense number into a separate field
That can be done with a one-line script like this:

````bash
perl -pE 's/(\\mn )(.*?)( [0-9]+)$/$1$2\n\\mnsn$3/'  <Dictionary-mn2xref.sfm >Dictionary-mn2xref-addmnsn.db
````

A subsequent script, *mn2xref.pl*, will process the 2nd mn reference.


````SFM
\lx olehuntmay
\mn olemay
\mnsn 2
\lf EC-2 
\lv unthay
````
Once this file has been set up and imported, the script can be run. It will set the first component reference to from the entry "mole" the 2nd sense of "mole 2" rather than the entry itself.
### Preparation
#### Infrastructure
The scripts in this repo require Linux **bash** and a properly configured **perl** system. These requirements are fulfilled if you follow the instructions here: [**Set up a Linux terminal**](https://sites.google.com/sil.org/importing-sfm-to-flex/workflow/i-set-up-infrastructure/b-set-up-a-linux-terminal).  Those instructions tell you how to set up a **WSL** terminal on Windows 10. That page also tells you how to navigate Windows directories from within **WSL**. (**WSL** is the **W**indows **S**ubsystem for **L**inux)

The instructions are part of the SIL Dictionary and Lexical Services **Importing SFM to FLEx: Best Practices** site.

Create or choose a working directory. It should be empty.
#### Prepare to run the scripts

Instructions for how to download files from *github* are available from SIL Dictionary and Lexical Services **Importing SFM to FLEx: Best Practices** site, at: [How to download Perl scripts from GitHub](https://sites.google.com/sil.org/importing-sfm-to-flex/workflow/i-set-up-infrastructure/c-how-to-download-perl-scripts-from-github).

Download the following following scripts and files from [this repository](https://github.com/WesPeacock/MmSetSense) on *github*:

* **MmSetSense.ini**
* **MmSetSense.pl**
* **README.md**

Move the downloaded files into the working directory.

Edit the **MmSetSense.ini** file and choose values for the following lines:

````ini
FwdataIn=FwProject-before.fwdata
FwdataOut=FwProject.fwdata
MnSenseMarker=mnsn
LogFile=MnSetSense-log.txt
````
Names of the items are on the right hand side of the equals sign. Don't put any spaces before or after the name.

#### Run the scripts

Navigate to the working directory within **WSL**.

There should be a copy the *.fwdata* file from the location you noted when you created it, in the working directory.

In **WSL**, type:
	**dos2unix** **\***
This converts the script and control file line endings.

In **WSL**, type:

â€‹	**./MnSetSense.pl** 

That script produces a log file with a list of all the entries that have been changed, and the changes that have been made. The user should review the changes for correctness and make the changes in the FLEx project, or make the changes in the SFM file and re-import the file.

#### Run FLEx to check your results


### Issues
The relevant EntryRef item in the FLEx project should not have multiple ComponentLexemes, PrimaryLexemes or ShowComplexFormsIn fields.
If it does, this should be noted in the log file and the entry should be ignored.
